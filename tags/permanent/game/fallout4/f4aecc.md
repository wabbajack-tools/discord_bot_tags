## Anniversary DLC/Creation Club Content

### Your chosen modlist requires the purchasable Anniversary Edition / Creations Bundle DLC.

Please make sure you've bought it for the same storefront version as your Fallout 4.
[Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3868650/Fallout_4__Creations_Bundle/).

Do note, the account currently logged in MUST own it themselves.
It will not work with family sharing as the content is downloaded from Bethesda's servers.
And the AE Upgrade / Creations Bundle is only linked to the Steam account which purchased it.

If you have already bought Creations Bundle and your log says you are missing creation club content (*Data_ccbgsfo4024-pacamo03 - main.esl, Data_ccbgsfo4035-pint.esl, etc...*) then you need to (re)download the content from within the game.

* Close Wabbajack
* Launch Fallout 4 from Steam
* Select Creations from the main menu
* Select Options at the bottom
* Select Download all owned Creation Club Creations

**DO NOT Alt+Tab; you must leave the game window active or the download will stop.**

* Exit the game
* Re-run Wabbajack and the modlist you're trying to install

### If Wabbajack still reports missing AE / Creations files

If "download all" doesn't work and some files are still missing, check your Wabbajack log for the missing DLC files, [match them with the relevant Creation Club mod from this list](https://fallout.wiki/wiki/Record_file#Creation_Club), and download each one manually from the in-game Creation Club menu.

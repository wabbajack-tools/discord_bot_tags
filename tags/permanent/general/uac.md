## Do Not Run Wabbajack as Admin

Wabbajack **DOES NOT** support non-standard Windows installations. This includes installations with UAC disabled or removed.

If you have UAC disabled - re-enable via the Control Panel and restart your PC (refer to the image below).

If you have a customised installation of Windows and cannot access UAC try the following:
1. Create a basic user account (Accounts -> Other users then add other user, click on Users, more actions and create new user)
2. Login to that account - start Skyrim to add the registry entries for that user
3. Log back into your primary account
4. Hold shift, right click the .exe which will give a "Run as different user" command
5. Select your created basic user

*Wabbajack is not responsible for any issues arising from attempting to run the application on non-standard Windows installations.*

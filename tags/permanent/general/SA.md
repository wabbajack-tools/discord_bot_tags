# No Modlists Matching Specified Criteria Found

South America is currently having issues with connecting to the GitHub API, which Wabbajack uses to fetch the data for modlists.
If you're located in South America and want to use Wabbajack, you need to use a VPN at the moment.
You mostly just need to use the VPN when starting up Wabbajack, and to download some Github files depending on the modlist.

It's out of our hands, since it's some internet routing issue either in South America or with some Github datacenter there.

If you want to keep an eye on the status of this problem, we can only suggest following this discussion thread, as there hasn't been any official response nor announcement from Github,
